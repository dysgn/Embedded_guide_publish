# Example 17: SPI_Gyro_2

This directory provides the architectural layout, header files (.h), and structural interfaces for the SPI_Gyro_2 application layer.

## 🎯 Architectural Overview
*   Description: Same as SPI_Gyro, but using array read of registers and DMA for SPI.
*   Key Technologies & Drivers: Combines advanced DMA multi-buffering with rapid continuous array transfers to read multi-axis register states with near-zero latency.
*   Language/Stack: C/C++ (Embedded Target Firmware via ST HAL), Python (Host Utility Scripting)

## 📁 Repository Contents
*   include/ / headers/: Architectural interfaces and driving configurations.
*   src/: [Implementation files (.c/.cpp) are excluded from the public repository layout]
